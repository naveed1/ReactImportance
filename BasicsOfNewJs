Difference between block and function scope
Block scope can be:
{//block scope}
if(){ // block scope}
for(...){ //block scope}

Function scope is:
function(){//functon scope}


In block scope, var will return its value outside of block scope also. Not in function scope.
Instead use 'let' keyword, its scope is local to block scope

Difference between let, const and var:

for const, the reference remains same. Which means it will always point to the same position in memory

Scalar variables(Integer and String) are always immutable for Javascript
Array or object are mutable. So const with them means, value can change. However the reference remains constant.

/*
      const obj = {
        key: value
      };
*/

const mystery = 'answer';
const InverseOfPI = 1 / Math.PI;

const obj = {
	p1: 10,
  p2: 20,
  f1() {},
  f2: () => {},
  [mystery]: 42,
  InverseOfPI,
};

console.log(obj);
